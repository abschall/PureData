**/MultiTapDelay.project** contains two Analog Delay patches. 

- *AnalogDelay.pd* simple Analog Delay
- *AnalogMultiTapDelay.pd* builds upon the simple Analog Delay and is a 4 tap delay, with Delay Ratio control, between the 4 taps. 
- *DelayTestingPlatform.pd* simple interface to test the patches

**/my_audio.examples** my implementation patches of the examples from **"The Theory and Technique of Electronic 
Music"**, by Miller Puckette (Don't mind me)

**/pd_docs** Pure Data documentation and examples 

**/Reverb.project** contains different reverb algorithm patches : Schroeder Reverb, Dattorro Reverb, Moorer Reverb, a custom "PlateReverb"
as well as different comb filter and allpass filter subpatches

- */Reverb.Testing.Platform* template files of simple interface to test the patches
- */reverb.basic.blocks* Various types of reverberator Lego bricks.
- */Dattorro* Jon Dattorro's Reverb 
- */Schroeder* Schroeder's Reverb algorithms from 1961 and 1962
- */Moorer* My take on James A. Moorer's "About This Reverberation Buisness" reverb algorthms
- */PlateReverb* An ambient plate reverb with vibrato in the reverberator, I call it the _Abyssal Reverb_   
- */Boiing* TBD
